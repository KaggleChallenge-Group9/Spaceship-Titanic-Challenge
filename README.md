## 👨‍🚀 Project Summary

Welcome to our repository for the **Spaceship Titanic Challenge**, a machine learning competition hosted on Kaggle. Our objective was to develop predictive models that determine whether a passenger was **transported to an alternate dimension** during a futuristic interstellar voyage.

Our group, **Cosmic Learners**, collaboratively built a complete and reproducible machine learning pipeline, including exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

## 🧠 Project Workflow

This notebook showcases a comprehensive machine learning pipeline divided into the following structured sections:

### 1. 🧭 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Univariate & bivariate feature exploration  
- Correlation analysis  
- Visualizations using seaborn, matplotlib, squarify, and pie charts  
- Identification of missing values and patterns

### 2. 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Missing value imputation (mean/mode strategy)  
- Feature extraction from `Cabin`, `Name`, and other composite fields  
- Label encoding for categorical variables  
- Standardization of numerical features

### 3. 🧪 Model Training & Evaluation
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost  
- Deep Neural Network (Keras Sequential Model)  
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, AUC-ROC  
- ROC Curves & Model Comparison Charts

### 4. 🔍 Hyperparameter Tuning
- `GridSearchCV` for Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost  
- EarlyStopping & ReduceLROnPlateau for DNNs  
- PCA used optionally for dimensionality reduction & visualization

### 5. 📈 Explainability
- Model explainability with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)  
- Visual insights into feature contributions for top predictions

### 6. 📤 Submission Generation
- Final prediction pipeline applied to the test set  
- Submission file generated in proper Kaggle format
